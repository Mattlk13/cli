Tutorial: Build Your Own Migrations Library
===========================================

This guide will provide a general overview of how you can build your own migrations library using the Baleen CLI
framework.

We'll use Doctrine Migrations as inspiration for our examples, but keep in mind that you can create a migration library
for virtually anything using Baleen.

Doctrine Intro
--------------

Since Doctrine Migrations will be our main example for the guide, its worth mentioning some basic things about how
Doctrine works and what exactly we're set to accomplish here.

Doctrine provides applications with a flexible database abstraction layer. In other words its the interface between an
application and one or more databases. Among other things, Doctrine provides an ObjectManager as one of the entry points
to most of the functionality. This "entry point" is an important concept to keep in mind when building a migration
library.

What's important under the scope of this guide is that the purpose of building a migrations library for Doctrine is to
provide a mechanism to ensure the database schema - and potentially some data - remains consistent across different
environments.

Overview
--------

During the course of this tutorial we'll accomplish the following key goals:

#. Create the skeleton for our migrations library based in Baleen CLI.
#. Create a Doctrine-specific :doc:`storage` service.
#. Create a Doctrine-specific abstract migration class that can be extended by concrete migrations.
#. Link to the application: inject the application's ObjectManager into that Migration class.
#. Customize the configuration schema to offer options to configure the Storage and other aspects of our new library.

Getting Started
---------------

The first step of creating your own migrations library is to copy the skeleton of Baleen CLI into a new folder. The
skeleton consists of these files:

* :file:`bin/baleen`: entry point for unix systems. All it does is include the bootstrap file.
* :file:`bin/bootstrap.php`: bootstrap script for your application.
* :file:`config/defaults.php`: default values for your configuration file.
* :file:`config/providers.php`: contains a list of providers that will be loaded during bootstrap.
* :file:`src/Application`: specifies you application's name and version.

You can optionally also copy the test configuration files if you'd like to use a similar approach to testing.

Next initialize Composer (``composer init``) and include the following dependencies:

    * ``baleen/cli:dev-master``
    * ``doctrine/dbal``: if you're building for another library then you'd reference that other library instead, of
      course.

Then rename :file:`bin/baleen` to whatever makes sense for your new migrations library, e.g. :file:`bin/migrations` -
and add a reference to it in your composer.json file:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "bin": {
            "bin/migrations"
        }
    }

Finally, customize the :file:`src/Application.php` file to use the name and version of your library.

After all of this you should already be able to test your binary by executing ``bin/migrations`` in your terminal and
see a list of available commands.

At this point you might find it interesting that if you run any of those commands they will WORK, only that the
functionality provided is the default Baleen CLI functionality. That's because we haven't customized any of the
providers, and therefore all of the providers (:file:`config/providers.php) that are being loaded by the bootstrap file
are still the default Baleen CLI providers.

Creating the Doctrine Storage Service
-------------------------------------

By default Baleen CLI stores versions into a :file:`.baleen_versions` file. Since we want to version a database it would
make sense to store the database version in the database itself. Doing that is easy. The goal for this step is to create
a ``DoctrineStorage`` class that implements ``Baleen\Migrations\Storage\AbstractStorage`` and implements all missing
functions (such as ``doFetchAll()``, ``saveCollection()``, etc.).

First create a ``Version`` entity for Doctrine. All it needs is an "id" field of the type "string", unique and
primary-key. That field will store the id of the version that has been migrated.

.. note::

    The resulting entity class can be found in the Doctrine Migrations repository under ``lib/Entity/Version``.

    .. TODO: add extenal link to the previous class reference

Then create the ``DoctrineStorage`` class. Extend ``AbstractStorage`` and implement the missing methods. You can use a
constructor (or setters) to inject the dependencies it will need for its methods. For example you'll want to inject the
ObjectManager, a doctrine Repository, or possibly even both - depending on your needs. You can see a finished
DoctrineStorage class in the same Github repository linked above under ``lib/Storage/DoctrineStorage.php``.

Finally, all that's left is to declare a service in the Container that will return DoctrineStorage under a predefined
service name. The predefined service name can simply be referenced using the :php:const:`Services::STORAGE` constant.
Since a Storage object is meant to be stateless it can be declared as a singleton. Keep in mind the service factory must
take care of injecting the Doctrine dependencies (Object Manager and/or Entity Repository) during instantiation.

To declare that service simply create a new Service Provider class and add it to the list of providers in
:file:`config/providers.php` - you can use any string as the key but "storage" is self-explanatory. You should also
remove the reference to the default storage provider.

.. note::

    The resulting Storage Provider class can be found in the Doctrine Migrations repository under file
    ``lib/Provider/StorageProvider``, which works together with ``lib/Provider/DoctrineProvider`` to inject the Doctrine
    dependencies.

With the ``DoctrineStorage`` service in place would be able to use the migration commands just like you would with
vanilla Baleen CLI, only that instead of saving migrated versions in a file they will be saved to a database. It won't
work just yet though.

Creating the Abstract Migration Class
-------------------------------------

Baleen Migrations provides a default migration class that all concrete migrations can extend:
``Baleen\Migrations\Migration\SimpleMigration``. This simple, abstract migrations class extends
``Baleen\Migrations\Migration\MigrationInterface`` and also
``Baleen\Migrations\Migration\Capabilities\OptionsAwareInterface`` in order to provide "some" contextual information to
the concrete migration implementations. However, in the context of Doctrine Migrations, ``SimpleMigration`` is not
enough. We want concrete migrations to be able to easily access the ObjectManager, which we need to inject during or
immediately after instantiation.

In order to make that easy, Baleen Migrations offers the ability to specify a "Migration Factory". This special factory
must extend ``Baleen\Migrations\Migration\Factory\FactoryInterface``, and in Baleen CLI the factory can simply be
offered as a service named after the :php:const:`Services::MIGRATION_FACTORY` constant. If you read the previous
section you should already understand how to do that (hint: you'll want to replace the "repository" provider).

.. note::

    The resulting Doctrine-specific ``MigrationFactory`` class can be found in the Doctrine Migrations repository at
    ``lib/Migration/MigrationFactory``. And the provider can be found at ``lib/Providers/MigrationRepositoryProvider``.

As for the abstract migration class itself, which we'll simply name ``AbstractMigration`, it will require Doctrine's
``ObjectManager`` on the constructor and make it available to concrete migrations as a protected property.

.. note::

    An example of the abstract migration class can also be found in the Doctrine Migrations repository at
    ``lib/Migration/AbstractMigration``.

Linking to the Application
--------------------------

With the ``Storage`` and ``AbstractMigration`` classes in place and their respective services properly configured,
there's still one more thing to do before the migration commands can be executed: we have to find a way to pick up the
application's Object Manager and inject it to both the Storage service and the Migration Factory service. Regardless of
how we approach this, we'll need a bit of the end-user's help.

The way Doctrine typically does this kind of integration (that is: for its other CLI tools) is by allowing the user to
load the application's Object Manager into a Console Helper (instance of ``Symfony\Component\Console\Helper\Helper``)
through a pre-defined integration file at the root of the project named :file:`cli-config.php`. For more information
about how the file can make the integration work refer to the Doctrine documentation.

.. TODO: link to the reference above

So as far as we're concerned all we need to do is check if that file exists, load it, and then add the resulting Console
Helper to our Application class. The code for that can go in the :file:`bin/boostrap.php` file or in a special provider.
In DoctrineMigrations we opted for a more comprehensive approach, and the code for this particular integration approach
can be found in ``lib/Providers/HelperSetProvider.php``.

An alternative to this approach would be to offer users the possibility to configure access to the database inside the
migration configuration file (the one created with the command ``bin/migrations init``). We would then pick up the
configuration and instantiate our own Object Manager based on it. But that approach requires more work from the end-user
(e.g. maintain two separate doctrine configuration files for the same database), so it shouldn't be the primary way to
integrate. In Doctrine Migrations we chose to offer end-users the ability to choose freely which of the  two approaches
they prefer.

Once you're able to access to the application's Object Manager from within the application you can make it a service in
the container. Offering it as a service will make your life easier because you can then adjust the definitions of the
Storage and MigrationFactory services to receive the Object Manager service during instantiation.

.. note::

  Its worth mentioning that building a migrations tool for a generic doctrine-based project is harder than building a
  similar tool for an application framework (like Laravel, Wordpress or Magento, for example). The reason is that
  application frameworks tend to be convention-driven, which means the "entry point" to their database and their models
  is a well-known convention. That's not the case with configuraton-driven frameworks (like ZF2 or  Symfony for
  example), which they tend to be harder to integrate with because their "entry point" is not a convention and is
  therefore essentially unknown until it gets configured by the user.

Custom Configuration Schema
---------------------------

If you followed the previous steps you'd notice that if at this point you issue the **config:init** command your generated
configuration file will still have a "storage.file" option (used so the user can choose the name of the file used by
``FileStorage`` to store the list of migrated versions).

But we're not using file storage anymore - we're using Doctrine Storage - so that configuration option is obsolete.
Let's remove it.

You can easily replace the default configuration class (:php:class:`Config`) by simply creating a new configuration
class that extends :php:class:`ConfigInterface`. Then register that class in the Container (in a similar way as
indicated in previous steps) using the :php:const:`Services::CONFIG` constant. And finally provide the default values
for the configuration file by implementing the :php:meth:`ConfigInterface::getDefaults` function.

You can then supply a different "definition" (refer to the :php:ns:Symfony\\Config` module for more information) by
creating a new definition class and implementing the :php:meth:`ConfigInterface::getDefinition` function so that it
returns your own definition. This custom definition would of course not include rules for the option we want to get rid
of.

Next time you run the **config:init** command, the default values from your Config class will be validated against the new
Definition, and then written into the file.

You can see examples of a custom configuration file and definition in the Doctrine Migrations repository inside the
``lib/Config`` folder.

Conclusion
----------

In this guide we built a doctrine-specific migrations library that can be used by developers that use Doctrine in their
project. Several other Baleen CLI features were not covered, but if you understood how you can use the Container and its
providers to customize Baleen to your needs then this tutorial's ultimate goal has been accomplished, and you should be
in good shape to get started on your own.
